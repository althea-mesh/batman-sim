# Batman Sim

This is a light simulator of the Batman V routing protocol. It is definitely not accurate, and there's an emphasis on only coding the features and attributes necessary for any given test I am doing.

It's also live online at: [https://jsfiddle.net/jh9wvaef/](https://jsfiddle.net/jh9wvaef/)

Look in the console for a list of edges and nodes. Each node has an `originators` property storing the best next hop and estimated throughput to all the other nodes in the network.
